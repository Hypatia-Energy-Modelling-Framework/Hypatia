Ususally, the technological interest rate is different from the general discount rate which depends on the central bank of each specific region. However, if the user insert similar values for these two parameters, the stream of economic lifetime payments would be equivalent to a single payment of the whole investment in year \"k\". In this case study, the default interest rate of 5% has been considered for all the technologies. Therefore, the discount rate and technological interest rate are equal and no investment annuity will be accounted.</li>"

These values are multiplied to the weightings of days/nights distributions where 80% percent of the daily demands are taking place in the days and 20% in the nights.
